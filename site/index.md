Thank you for taking part in this experiment!

Your task is to pick 1 out of 6 test sounds that is **most similar** to a
recording of singing-voices (the reference). The test sounds are taken from
different source separation methods that try to extract singing-voices from a
song. The best source separation method should produce a test sound that is
perceptually identical to the original recording.

Examples of things that might influence your decision:

- Portions of the original recording missing
- Artefacts, such as noise
- Changes to the timbre of the singing-voice
- The presence of other instruments that are absent in the reference, e.g. guitars, drums
